=The Social Smart Contract.=
An Initial Rights Offering from [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation].

==i. Abstract.==

In a world that has succeeded in the globalization of financial assets while keeping political rights enclosed to territories, we need to build new models of democratic governance that enable humanity to colaborate and address pressing global issues. Democracy Earth Foundation is building free, open source software for incorruptible, blockchain-based voting within institutions of all sizes, from the most local involving two people to the most global involving all of us. Uneven distribution of opportunity around the globe due to the perpetual confrontation between national governments has led to accelerated climate change, rising inequality, terrorism and forced migrations.  Democracy Earth Foundation proposes that the technology stack that includes Bitcoin as programmable money without Central Banks, and Ethereum enabling smart contracts without the need of Judiciary Courts, requires a new layer that signals incorruptible votes beyond the territorial boundaries of Nation-States. This transnational network will act in accordance with the personal sovereignty of its members and protect their human rights with encryption. In our Initial Rights Offering we offer a token called ''VOTE'' that will grant participation rights to every human with decision making as its main function. We seek nothing less than true democratic governance for the Internet age, one of the foundational building blocks of an achievable global peace and prosperity arising from an arc of technological innovations that will change what it means to be human on Earth.

==iii. Background.==

We pioneered digital democracy having authored some of the most prominent open source democracy software [https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=topic%3Ademocracy&type=Repositories as ranked by the Github community] including the original design of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNCgfd7dNb0 DemocracyOS], a simple direct democracy project we created in 2012. We founded the first digital political party in the Americas, the [http://partidodelared.org Partido de la Red] (Peers Party) that ran for its first election in the city of Buenos Aires in 2013 [http://www.wired.co.uk/article/e-voting obtaining 1.2% of the votes]. In 2014 we shared our experience in [https://www.ted.com/talks/pia_mancini_how_to_upgrade_democracy_for_the_internet_era TED] reaching over 1.2 million viewers. During 2015 and 2016, Silicon Valley's [http://ycombinator.com Y Combinator] and [http://ffwd.org Fast Forward] funded our efforts to start the [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation], a non-profit organization committed to the mission of borderless governance.

Our experience combining both the political and technological challenges of democracy led us to think and design around the notion of how we could build a political party using smart contracts, or rather a lightweight form of governance anyone can implement at a low cost. We began the development of [http://sovereign.software Sovereign], a '''''blockchain liquid democracy''''' that enables direct voting on issues or the ability to delegate voting power on specific topics to peers over a secure network without central authority. By operating with tokens signaled on a blockchain all votes become censorship resistant and immediate audit rights can be granted to every voter without needing to provide access to servers or private infrastructure, thus making the system open and transparent for all. Our work is driven by open source software development practices and cooperates with key projects aiming to secure identity in decentralized environments including efforts from [https://blockstack.org/blockstack_usenix16.pdf Blockstack], [http://civic.com Civic] and [https://whitepaper.uport.me/uPort_whitepaper_DRAFT20170221.pdf Consensys] among others.

[https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign Sovereign's codebase] delivers an adaptive mobile and desktop application to voters and organizations standardizing incorruptible decision-making in a blockchain based democracy. Our aim is to continue paving the road of implementations that enable [https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec08/tech/full_papers/adida/adida.pdf cryptographic open-audit voting] and integrate our software with blockchains able to guarantee the sovereign rights of users.

==1. Manifesto.==

<blockquote>
  Democracy is always a work in progress, it’s never an absolute idea or it would otherwise be a totalitarian ideology just like all the rest of them.
</blockquote>
'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mujica José Mujica]''', President of Uruguay (2010–2015).

Current democratic systems governing societies under the territorial domain of Nation-States have grown stagnant in terms of participation and are leading towards increased polarization. Constituencies are provided with tailor-made media that satisfies their own endogamic beliefs, pulling society apart as discourse and factual debate are replaced with a post-truth mindset. This is a consequence of the drastic expansion in communication channels that shrank attention spans rendering thoughtful analysis expendable. Centralized 20th century information distribution created uniform narratives, realities and identities. The Internet has fractured them. Instances of political participation in the so-called modern democracies are not apt for information abundant contexts and have remained without change since their inception.

[[File:/images/bipartizan-votes-us-congress.png|Bi-partizan votes in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1981, source: The Rise of Partizanship (2015).]]

Engagement through the traditional channels is weaker among younger generations, [http://www.economist.com/news/essays/21596796-democracy-was-most-successful-political-idea-20th-century-why-has-it-run-trouble-and-what-can-be-do often not going out to vote and unlikely to engage in party politics]. Meanwhile online activism is increasing with social media becoming the dominant arena for political clashes. This includes Facebook and Twitter (where gossip dissemination is predominant with ''fake news'', ''bots'' and ''trolling'' among other campaign optimizations) and emergent echo chambers like [http://www.4chan.org/ 4chan.org] where anonymity led to political incorrectness or [https://gab.ai/ gab.ai] consolidating the ''alt-right'' community in the USA. Needless to say: endogamy only makes polarization stronger, and our tribalized societies have shown a tendency to continue relativizing truth [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html risking the preservation of resources] and the survival of future generations.

Democratic processes seen during high-stakes elections are often prone to fraudulent behavior with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering ''gerrymandering''] becoming commonplace and a strong link between what the [https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/WP_48_Ferguson_et_al.pdf major political parties spend and the percentage of votes they win]. In developing nations exploits are literal having ballot boxes burnt by large parties to suffocate the chances of smaller competitors. 

This paper proposes a solution that will tackle both the political and technical issues currently weakening the prospects of democracy in the world by offering an alternative that can be adopted directly by citizens and implemented using peer to peer networks. As the internet becomes the dominant force in modern politics we see an indispensable need to develop digital technology for voting that can be securely deployed in any geographical location and for communities of any size.

With internet growth [http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32884867 reaching over 3 billion lives] (far surpassing major religions and Nation-States) and the development of encrypted networks known as blockchains permitting incorruptible transactions with permissionless audits, there’s no reason stopping mankind from building a borderless commons that can help shape the next evolutionary leap for democratic governance. Even in regions where internet penetration is below 50%, the digital gap is not based on socio-economic factors but it is rather a generational divide. According to Rick Falkvinge, founder of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party Pirate Party]: “Politics moves at glacial speeds: nothing seems to happen until suddenly a strenuous noise gets everyone's attention. It is slow because it often takes one generation to die for the next one to take over. And today we live in a world that has the ''offline generation'' in charge and the ''online generation'' growing up”.

New forms of governance must acknowledge the networked commons connecting humanity and progressively weaken the legacy of national frontiers and its inherent inability to address pressing global issues such as climate change, rising inequality, terrorism, automation and forced migrations. Uneven distribution of opportunity around the globe due to the perpetual confrontation between national governments led to the rise of these issues in the global agenda. We believe the technology stack that includes [http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf Bitcoin] as programmable money without Central Banks and [http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/index.html Ethereum] enabling smart contracts without the need of Judiciary Courts requires a new layer that signals incorruptible votes beyond the boundaries of Nation-States. This transnational network will act in accordance to the personal sovereignty of its members and protect their human rights with encryption.

===1.2 Legacy.===

We can consider elections implemented by states, provinces and city municipalities as democracies where we are reduced to being passive recipients of a monologue. Citizens are called between substantially long periods of time, during elections, to provide a basic input: essentially accept or reject players in the same system: this is the bandwidth of the legacy system that is our so-called ''modern democracies''. Under these systems less than one percent of the population is able to vote on legislation or execute budgets while the rest are legally forced to outsource their full citizenship rights to a representing minority that eventually figures out how to perpetuate itself.

The technology behind ''representative democracies'' can be grouped in two sets:

* '''Analogue elections''': usually paper ballots and ballot boxes with authorities responsible for counting votes and reporting fraudulent behavior. Even though these systems are stable in developed nations, they suffer from severe lack of participation. Barriers are implemented with requirements such as the need to register to vote through an excessively bureaucratic process that ends up blocking a majority of disenfranchised voters. Authorities also gerrymander districts exploiting survey data in anticipation of electoral outcomes. Even though these systems are easier to audit, this also means that they’re easier to corrupt: in developing nations ''analogue elections'' get subverted by mobs representing large parties that burn or 'disappear' ballot boxes, threatening auditors from smaller competitors and letting violence overrun the process in key districts. In our experience with the [http://partidodelared.org Partido de la Red] running for the City Congress of Buenos Aires in the 2013 elections we found out that no effort mattered more than having sufficient party auditors to cover every district in the city or otherwise votes would get stolen. The larger an election’s territory is, the less likely an analogue system can guarantee a fair process. Further,  high implementation costs end up limiting elections to a handful of days per year (if any), rendering democracy an exception rather than the norm regarding how governments actually get elected.

[[File:/images/nation-state-voter-turnout.png|Territorial voting.]]

* '''Electronic voting''': proposals that deliver solutions based on electronic voting machines aim to secure the process through a digital interface yet with the same logic of few elections per year, i.e. legitimizing professional politicians is served. Machines can effectively help avoid [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clientelism clientelist] techniques used to corrupt an election but open a whole new surface of attack by exposing ballots to the risk of undetected hacks and foreign intervention. Experts on this field ([https://www.ndi.org/e-voting-guide/examples/constitutionality-of-electronic-voting-germany including the Supreme Court of Germany]) recommend using electronic voting machines that leave a paper trail [https://www.amazon.com/Voting-Wars-Florida-Election-Meltdown/dp/0300198248 or any alternative medium] for vote proof. Technology can also be introduced directly by citizens using smartphone apps to perform ''parallel vote tabulation'' to report partial tallies across different polling stations as a safeguard against official reports. By their very nature, computing systems keep logs and cannot guarantee vote secrecy. For this reason any logging of a digital voting system should be public by default and trustless, operating with a distributed ledger syncing the outputs of a shared network. In short: a blockchain.

Traditional analog and electronic elections are strictly for long-term, representative democracies with elective periods ranging from 4 to 6 years. But the underlying dynamic of these systems is that officials are pre-elected from the top-down and presented for citizens to legitimize with their vote. The argument that citizens lack the knowledge and preparation to fulfill political responsibility and don’t have enough time in their daily lives to engage in public affairs is weak on merit: more often than not public servants require input from experts on specific fields to draft legislation. As well, thanks to the Internet, mobile phones, social media and satellites, we observably live in a world full of citizens routinely engaging in debate on political issues (albeit lacking any chances of genuine impact.)

===1.2 Geopolitics.===

A consequence of the US Presidential Election of 2016 is that the [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/qa-russian-hackers-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-us-presidential-election fear of foreign intervention] has become a leading threat to the security of electoral processes. But foreign attacks rarely consist on hijacking voting machines: directly manipulating votes can be easily traced and it is very expensive to impact on a scale large enough to satisfy an attacker. A more efficient approach is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack instilling public fear by collapsing internet infrastructure days prior to an election] in a way that can help push favoritism on a candidate that is perceived stronger than the other one. This kind of cyberattack able to trigger a shift in voter perception is nearly impossible to trace as political subversion and reveals the inherent conflict that a digital commons has with territorial democracies.

[[File:/images/hacked-america.png|Impact of DNS cyberattack (October 21, 2016) & Presidential Election (November 6, 2016).]]

This happened two weeks before the US 2016 election when a botnet coordinated through a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices executed a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_DoS Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack] that affected Domain Name System (DNS) provider Dyn Inc. bringing down major websites in the US including Amazon, Paypal, New York Times and Wall Street Journal among many others. In other words: ballot machines weren’t hacked, the voters’ minds were. Perpetrators remain undetected.

===1.3 Land vs. Cloud.===

<blockquote>
In the near future, electrons and light flow freely, and corporate computer networks eclipse the stars. Despite great advances in computerization, countries and race are not yet obsolete…
</blockquote>
[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/ '''''Ghost in the shell'''''], graphic novel (1995).

The 21st century is witnessing a growing conflict between ''The Land'': governments that monopolize the law on territorial jurisdictions by restricting the free movement of physical goods and bodies; and ''The Cloud'': corporations that monopolize access to user data able to track and target ideas via personalized advertising. In this world freedom is an illusion: our bodies belong to governments, our minds to corporations. Notorious battles from this conflict include the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute ''Apple versus FBI''] case requesting the jailbreak of an encrypted phone; or the historical dispute between [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/06/trumps-new-travel-ban-raises-the-same-silicon-valley-objections/?utm_term=.0854c54536d6 Silicon Valley’s cosmopolitanism seeking flexible visas and Washington D. C.’s nationalism raising migration barriers]. As this scenario unfolds, encryption plays a role of growing significance to protect the human rights of digital citizens as it can help them break apart from the ''cloud versus land'' trap.

[[File:/images/the-land.png|The land: monopolies on force.]]

The origins of digital cryptography go back to World War II when Alan Turing built the first proto-computers to decrypt Nazi messages. Since then encryption has been legislated in the USA in the same manner kept for traditional weapons: it is included in the ''Munitions List'' of the [https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html International Traffic in Arms Regulations] and related software and hardware must deal with export restrictions. And even though encryption is often considered a right protected under the First Amendment arguing that “code is speech”, its defensive nature indicates that it must also be protected under the umbrella of the Second Amendment since it holds the same reasoning behind the “right to bear arms”: In an era where [http://twitter.com/Snowden whistleblowers] are revealing how the ''Deep State'' spies on citizens anywhere around the globe, encrypted information is the only realistic guarantee that anyone has to be protected from government abuses (and the corporations that back them).

[[File:/images/the-cloud.png|The cloud: monopolies on data.]]

Secrecy is a fundamental property of free and fair elections as it is a mechanism that helps avoid coercion from those in power and prevents the risk of elections being bought and sold for money. Privacy is the best guarantee a conscious free mind has to think for itself. But on the modern internet: privacy is illusory when using Facebook, Google or any web based service. Even though Internet monopolies pretend being the gatekeepers of online privacy, theoretically Facebook can still impersonate any of its 2 Billion registered users if they ever wanted to. Google and Facebook hold the largest identity databases in the world surpassing the governments of India and China, while [https://twitter.com/AdrianChen/status/832452637320556544 97% of their reported revenue comes from advertising] severely conditioning the kind of experience that users get with their technology. It is in their interest to gather as much information as possible to profile people in order to stay competitive in the attention market and both companies filter information fed to users with [https://medium.com/@piamancini/future-scenarios-for-algorithmic-accountability-and-governance-17cd436d22a0 algorithms accountable] to anyone but their own board. None of their services are really free: personal sovereignty is given away in the same way the natives in the American continent got distracted watching their own ''selfies'' in shiny mirrors 500 years ago while the European conquistadors swept their entire way of life at a whim. Uncensored, free and sovereign debates on the future of humanity are being eaten by useless ''likes'' that only help perpetuate these corporate entities. ''Fake news exploits'' (as they were used during the U.S. elections) or critical content spreading like wildfire (as it happened during the ''Arab Spring'') demonstrates that any effort to stop international influence on national politics is futile as societies spend their most of their time online. The Internet is incompatible with Nation-States.

===1.4 Intelligence.===

<blockquote>
  I can’t let you do that, Dave.
</blockquote>
'''HAL 9000''' on ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968).

The best civic tech is tech that gets used every day. Already, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms have  become by proxy the main interface citizens use to influence everyday politics. But the unseen consequences of giving personal data away through centralized web services can be many and with relevant implications for the future of humanity. The information architecture of how personal data is stored, shared and monetized is fundamental to understand sovereignty in the 21st century.

A looming threat is the use of unrestricted Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gets fueled by user generated content without any kind of public supervision evident in a former Blackwater employee’s revelation to us how data gets weaponized: from an office in Dubai he was able to drive and get the live feed of a drone flying over Syria or Pakistan. Surprisingly, the decision whether to kill the target wasn’t made by the human operator (or a supervising authority) but by an AI that called the shots over the Internet “at least 90% of the time“. This AI was provided by the Silicon Valley company Palantir founded by Peter Thiel (seed investor and Facebook board member). Often described as a Facebook spin-off to provide intelligence services to the CIA, Palantir is credited with having found Osama Bin Laden in 2011.

The issue on AI deciding on the fate of human lives opens up ethical and moral questions. Eventually not even human researchers are able to properly understand how an AI is behaving, becoming a threat if it is a key component of military grade technology. According to author Yuval Noah Harari: “intelligence is breaking apart from living organisms and it won’t be monopolized by carbon beings for long.” Consciousness is the new political frontier being drawn. A line between machines and humans. In other words: understanding whether we are using the machines or the machines are using us. How we structure human organizations —and govern the code running them— defines who is in charge. As the capacity of silicon intelligence matches Moore’s Law growth rates, humanity as a whole must ask itself how is going to govern the reins of this unprecedented power.

===1.5 Decentralization.===

<blockquote>
  Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.
</blockquote>
[https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Schmitt '''Carl Schmitt'''], political theorist (1888-1985).

The achilles heel of data hungry, attention farming internet monopolies is their need of a centralized information architecture. They rose as the ''superhubs'' in what used to be the promise of a web shaped network by implementing the winning solutions to the leading online use cases. But the consequence has been a privatized ecosystem: closed code, walled gardens and surveillance capitalism as the defaults on what could otherwise be a borderless commons. When Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the ''world wide web'' protocols, pointed out the intrinsic risks on today’s internet he requested the need to draft a [https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_a_magna_carta_for_the_web Magna Carta for the Web]: “Unless we have an open, neutral internet we can rely on without worrying about what's happening at the back door, we can't have open government, good democracy, connected communities and diversity of culture. It's not naive to think we can have that, but it is naive to think we can just sit back and get it.“

Centralization is the single point of failure in elections and is incompatible with democracy. In our experience implementing centralized digital voting for decisions of Partido de la Red we detected that if an election is high-stakes (all or most members have a biased interest in the outcome), the likelihood of the system being corrupted increases. The biggest risk lies in those who are responsible in controlling servers and database integrity. We have found out on [https://asamblea.partidodelared.org/topic/58eaf4739b96a611009bc3fc internal elections] held in early 2017 discrepancies between information reported by database auditors and the logs voters kept in their local machines: manipulation in vote emission data, aribitrary modification of poll closing date, erased records and sudden ban of registered accounts where proven and denounced leading to a generalized perception of fraud in the whole process. Centralized digital democracies without any consideration for cryptographic security are toys useful for playful purposes but can be dangerous when implemented in real scenarios under fraudulent hands.

Meanwhile, traditional elections have a technique known as ''adversarial counting'' when the outcome is close to a tie. Authorities of all involved parties participate in a manual vote count. But when an election happens within a large population, ''adversarial counting'' reduces the cost to subvert it by having an attacker only needing to bribe a few authorities from a competing party to secure a result. Any kind of system that requires trust from participants ultimately runs the risk of having its whole structure collapsing if any authority is fraudulent.

[[File:/images/blockchain-permissionless-audit-voting.png|Blockchain democracies enable permissionless audits.]]

Decentralization is a requirement of democracy. It cannot be guaranteed without it. Blockchains enable trustless systems eroding the need of human authority and increasing the defenses of vote integrity by enabling a shared resource that has scorekeeping as its main function. This permits unprecedented designs of electoral systems: '''With a blockchain-based democracy votes become censorship resistant and every single voter can audit an election without requiring any kind of access rights to specific infrastructure.''' By storing vote data in a blockchain rather than in private servers or ballot boxes, audit costs become abstracted and are turned into a guaranteed right for every participant. Voters are not just mere spectators but also sovereign gatekeepers of the whole process. This kind of transparency cannot be delivered by traditional electoral systems, analog or electronic.

===1.6 Sovereignty.===

On today's internet, voting has still emerged as the main interaction. Every time users ''like'', ''upvote'', ''heart'', ''link'' or ''retweet'' content they are signaling a preference that serves a feedback loop generating better recommendations for them. But the action won’t go any further: it’s a  ''fake vote'' that lacks institutional implications. ''Likes'' in social media operate as worthless tokens that can be inflated with a single click even though they set the price of advertising dollars. Network effects turned this interaction into a metric that highlights the influence of a specific idea within a crowd, often being a tool for those in power to survey society’s needs. But the financial and political benefits of these transactions are entirely kept by the [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html network owners].

[[File:/images/web-voting.png|Web voting.]]

Sovereign technology able to operate in peer to peer networks, preserving anonymity, encrypting data, decentralizing infrastructure, with free (''as in freedom'') open source code can completely disrupt the described landscape.

Throughout history only three kinds of sovereigns prevailed: the ''sovereign tribe'' where a crowd follows a leader; the ''sovereign king'' loyal only to God; and the ''sovereign republic'' with continental lands governed under one law. Blockchains operating in cyberspace are giving rise to a fourth kind: the ''networked individual''. It’s not a far fetched possibility: conquering [https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720 personal sovereignty] is already a reality for those who run their finances with bitcoin and other crypto hodlings. As investor [http://twitter.com/naval Naval Ravikant] puts it: “You can cross an international border carrying a billion dollars in bitcoin entirely in your head.” This kind of sovereign act is unprecedented even for contemporaneous Heads of State.

The widespread adoption of blockchains is giving rise to a model that initially grew under the shadows of established institutions but eventually will render them obsolete. Blockchains are automated bureaucracies that offer significant financial benefits in terms of transaction costs while completely abstracting the need of trusted intermediaries. They enable systems of free association that help break the political and financial coercion that governments and banks impose by restricting the right to vote or limiting access to capital. A technologically advanced society can flourish beyond territorial domains anywhere there is an internet connection with digital citizens emerging as a new kind of diaspora.

==2. Paper.==

<blockquote>
  Today, having a voice is an accident of birth.
</blockquote>
[https://twitter.com/piamancini '''Pia Mancini'''], hacktivist (1982).

A foundational principle of democracy is the right to be heard. Today most of the world’s population is not heard. Their individual and collective voices have been politically and economically silenced by ‘illiquidity’ - given no instruments to broadcast or amplify their marginalized voices. Modern democracies are the birthchilds of the ''Printing Press Era'': printed constitutional systems based on contracts and the speed of the postal service were the information technologies that led to representative systems.

[[File:/images/liquid.png|Direct democracy vs. Liquid Democracy.]]

A liquid democracy is based on a dynamic representation model that works with a bottom-up approach: citizens are able to freely elect within their social graph (friends, colleagues, family) who they want to have as representatives on a specific set of topics. It is the most flexible form of democratic governance that can be constructed with digital technology, operating as a hybrid that enables direct or delegated voting at any time. There are few precedents of trustworthy bottom-up environments that led to authoritative content, [https://www.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia] being a pioneering case. But if history is any guide, the last time Western Civilization faced [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment a paradigm shift regarding encyclopedic enlightment] it was precisely on the epoch preceding the rise of modern democracies.

This paper details the implementation of a liquid democracy using [http://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign Sovereign], our democratic governance application that operates with blockchain tokens using a basic set of smart contracts. Simplicity in the design and language used to express this design matters for the purpose of a genuinely democratic device. No technology will ever be able to satisfy democratic aspirations if it can only be understood by an elite. As cryptographer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle Ralph Merkle] stated:

<blockquote>
  We do not call upon ordinary untrained citizens to perform surgery, fly airplanes, design computers, or carry out the other myriad tasks needed to keep society functioning, what makes governance different? The problem is readily understood: if we give governance to “experts” they will make decisions in their own best interests, not in the best interests of us all.
</blockquote>

With Sovereign we are aiming to provide a lightweight governance framework that permits all stakeholders of an organization to participate and enforce decisions through the use of cryptocurrency. But it is important to state that we are not aiming for a democratic system based on mob-rule or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majoritarianism ''majoritarism'']. History offers sufficient examples on how a blind majority can end up failing the aspirations of a republic often putting demagogues in power. Our main goal is to deliver a system able to guarantee the greatest amount of legitimacy while empowering the most knowledgeable voices in any community.

===2.1 Token.===

An ideal voting system must be able to satisfy in the greatest possible extent these conditions:

* '''Secrecy''': voter must be able to cast vote in secret.

* '''Verifiability''': voter must be able to verify tallied vote.

* '''Integrity''': system must be able to verify correct vote tally.

Additionally, due to the risk that coercion through physical violence or threats in contexts prone to political violence, an option able to protect coerced voters must be introduced:

* '''Resistance''': voter must be able to override own vote if necessary.

In the work led by researchers Hosp & Vora, an [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/24d5/5c866a7317dae11d37518b312ee460bc33d3.pdf Information Theory approach was taken to model voting systems] leading to the conclusion that a natural tension exists with a system aiming for ''perfect integrity'', ''perfect ballot secrecy'' and ''perfect tally verifiability''. All three cannot be simultaneously achieved when an adversary is computationally unbounded, able to brute force a system if unlimited time or memory are available. For this reason we consider indispensable to implement digital democracies using blockchains. With network effects already in place, blockchains are able to verify transaction integrity and prevent token double-spending. Bitcoin’s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system ''proof of work''] model achieves this by rewarding computational capacity verifying transaction blocks (what is often referred as ''mining''), leading to a network “300 times more powerful than Google’s resources” according to [http://twitter.com/balajis Balaji Srinivasan], an [http://twitter.com/a16z Andreessen-Horowitz] partner. For this reason, our design is based on tokens within a blockchain network operating as ''political cryptocurrency''.

What differentiates a vote from money (or in broader terms: a ''political economy'' from a ''financial economy'') is that political currency is designed to guarantee participating rights under fair conditions to all members within an organization. Rights aim to satisfy overall legitimacy in the governance of an institution. While money is the language of self-interest, votes express the shared views of a community. Political currency is not strictly meant for individual trade but for social choice.

====2.1.1 Implementation.====

Considering that value [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin can be driven by memetic capacity], the Democracy Earth token granting voting rights will be branded with the single most important message any democracy can convey: ''VOTE''.

The ''VOTE'' token can be implemented using smart contract code across a variety of blockchains that permit [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness Turing Complete] scripts, including Bitcoin. Our design is blockchain agnostic in recognition of a computer science field still in its infancy where significant innovations remain to be invented. Nonetheless we are working on implementing the ''VOTE'' token under these smart contract environments:

* '''Ethereum''': Create a set of [https://github.com/ethereum/solidity solidity] smart contracts using the [https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard Ethereum ERC20 token standard].

** '''Rootstock''': Take necessary steps to make solidity code compatible with [http://www.rsk.co/ Rootstock's smart contract interpreter for the Bitcoin blockchain]

* '''Lightning''': With the activation of [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segregated_Witness segregated witness] in the Bitcoin protocol that enables routing of payment channels with the [http://lightning.network Lightning Network protocol], liquid democracy delegations can be mapped using satoshi-level transactions carrying an attached ''VOTE'' identifier.

Multi-chain implementations are encouraged in the spirit of seeking greater experimentation and collaboration regarding these technologies.

===2.2 Voting.===

The ''VOTE'' token aims to be a standard for digital democracy able to interoperate with other tokens as well, setting a common language for the governance of blockchain based organizations. Within the context of liquid democracies a specific set of voting transactions is permitted with ''VOTE'' tokens:

* '''Direct Vote''': Any selfish voter is allowed to use his or her tokens to vote directly on issues as in a direct democracy.

* '''Basic Delegation''': Alice may delegate ''VOTEs'' to Bob. As long as Bob has access to those tokens he can use them to vote on Alice's behalf.

* '''Tag Limited Delegation''': Alice may delegate ''VOTEs'' to Charlie under the specified condition that he can only use these tokens on issues carrying a specific tag. If the delegation specifies that delegated ''VOTEs'' can only be used on decisions with the ''#environment'' tag, then Charlie won't be able to use these anywhere else but on those specific issues. This leads to a representation model not based on territory but on knowledge.

* '''Transitive Delegation''': If Bob received ''VOTEs'' from Alice, he can then delegate these to Frank. This generates a chain of delegations that helps empower specific players within a community. If Alice does not desire to have third parties receiving the votes she delegated to Bob, she can turn off the transitive setting on the delegation contract.

* '''Overriding Vote''': If Bob already used the delegated ''VOTEs'' he received from Alice but she has a different opinion on a given issue, as the sovereign owner of her votes Alice can always override Bob's decision. All ''VOTEs'' within an organization are tied to their original member allocation and voters always have the final word on any given decision with their own ''VOTEs''.

* '''Public Vote''': Often referred as the ''golden rule'' of liquid democraices, all delegators have the right to know how their delegate has voted on any given issue with their ''VOTEs''. In the same way congressmen votes are public, on liquid democracies competing delegates on any given tag have an incentive to build a public reputation based on their voting record in order to attract more delegations.

* '''Secret Vote''': A method able to guarantee ''VOTE'' transactions untraceable to the voter. This is indispensable in contexts of public elections held within large populations. A road to be researched on is operating with blockchains designed for anonymous transactions with a proven track record: [https://z.cash ZCash] implements shielded transactions using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof zero-knowledge proofs] and [https://getmonero.org Monero] uses [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature ring signatures with stealth addresses]. A lighter implementation can be made to satisfy communities with less risk of coercion, but it is encouraged to pursue research regarding the integration with proven anonymous networks. Even if perfect secrecy on ''VOTE'' transaction is achieved, user's can still be fingerprinted with exposed meta-data.

===2.3 UX.===

User Experience (UX) is a critical aspect of a decentralized architecture and becomes even more important as the redundant layers of centralized architectures condense to the user. In a centralized internet architecture, the user does not own the interface or experience. In a decentralized internet architecture, the user interface (UI) should be based on user perspective. In this sense, transactions in the world get done only three distinct views:

* '''Self''': Using a public identity related to an individual.

* '''Organization''': In representation of an organization that extended representation rights (e.g. workplace, club, political party, etc).

* '''Anonymous''': Without any connection to a public identity.

This undertanding of ''SELF / ORG / ANON'' shape-shifting requirement highly influenced our interface and token design. At any given time a Sovereign user can adopt any of this modes to interact with decentralized organizations.

====2.3.1 Liquid.====

Sovereign aims to make liquid voting immediate and simple. Any friction in the process must be avoided and the delegation widget should be constantly exposed on the interface while browsing issues or looking at member profiles. Sovereign uses a ''liquid bar'' that permits transacting ''VOTEs'' with a single gesture either on mobile and desktop devices.

[[File:/images/liquid-mobile-ux.png|Sovereign mobile interface displaying decision, ballot and liquid voting.]]

The ''liquid bar'' allows these actions:

* '''Check available ''VOTEs''''': Since in a liquid democracy a user can have 1 or more delegated ''VOTEs'', having a constant reminder of the balance helps the user understand his current power within the system. If some of the ''VOTEs'' were delegated with strict conditions (e.g. limited to specific tags), this means that a user won't have the same amount of ''VOTEs'' available to spend on every issue.

* '''Check allocated ''VOTEs''''': A percentage value with the amount of ''VOTEs'' currently cast on other decisions or delegated to other members of the communtiy is shown. The user can tap or click at any time on that value to view a complete list of the issues where he's currently having a ''VOTE'' and decide whether to keep them there or change his mind.

* '''Slide and ''VOTE''''': The user can use his thumb (or mouse click) to slide the ''liquid bar'' handle and upon the release of it he will be prompted a confirmation request whether to ''VOTE'' or not.

* '''Tap and ''VOTE''''': If the user does not want to allocate more than 1 vote, he can simply tap on the ''liquid bar'' handle once and he will be prompted to confirm the singe ''VOTE'' transaction.

* '''Remove ''VOTEs''''': At any time, as long as the poll is still open, the user may remove his ''VOTEs'' from a decision by simply sliding the ''liquid bar'' handle back to the initial position.

We see this interaction as a step forward from the ''like'' pattern found in social media that limits voting to clicks.

====2.3.2 Delegations.====

The same implementation of the ''liquid bar'' also permits having a clear view on the ''VOTE'' delegation status a Sovereign user can have with any other member of an organization. Delegations go both ways: a user must be able to understand how many ''VOTEs'' he has received from someone else, while also be able to delegate any of his available ''VOTEs''. Every time a user profile is displayed on Sovereign, the overall current delegation status is shown.

[[File:/images/delegation-relation-votes.png|View of vote delegation relation with another member.]]

====2.3.3 Debate.====

Sovereign also has a debating component for every issue codenamed ''agora''. Debating is likely as important as voting on any democracy. Agoras display ''threaded conversations'', a design made popular by [http://reddit.com Reddit] and [http://news.ycombinator.com Hacker News], since we consider this UX pattern as the best way to engage in thoughtful conversations online. The most valued comments bubble up and helps sort the information of a debate using the collective intelligence of the community. But unlike web based applications, Sovereign does not allow testimonial interactions: instead of permitting infinite ''upvotes'' or ''downvotes'', if the user agrees with a comment from someone else in the platform by tapping the ''upvote'' button, this will trigger an instantaneous delegation of a single ''VOTE''. On the contrary, if a user disagrees with someone's comment, the ''downvote'' button can either retrieve a ''VOTE'' from the commenter to the user if he has previously delegated ''VOTEs''. We believe this will make delegations more frequent across the platform and as political debate becomes exposed to an environment always open to token transactions, develop a mechanisms that can reward good arguments and severely punish trolling attitudes.

====2.3.4 Security.====

Among the most notable research projects on liquid democracy there is the effort of [http://www.tdcommons.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=dpubs_series Google Votes]. This was an internal implementation made for Google employees led by engineer Steve Hardt where he created a liquid democracy plug-in to be used on the internal version of Google+. With it he tested different ballot and tallying methods having over 15,000 participants making 371 decisions on a wide range of issues. An insight from this project was the lack of delegations: only 3.6% of votes were delegated making the system a direct democracy for the most part. Delegations occured mostly among those users who actively campaigned to attract them. With this into consideration, the Sovereign UX needs constant iteration to help turn delegations a common habit and enable them not just in the application itself but also using other communication protocols so delegations can happen withing third party messaging applications or even tweets and e-mails sent with ''VOTE'' QR codes attached to them.

On the other side of the spectrum, when the German Pirate Party implemented [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiquidFeedback Liquid Feedback], a pioneering liquid democracy software developed in 2009, it reached a participation level of ~550 affiliates that led to [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/liquid-democracy-web-platform-makes-professor-most-powerful-pirate-a-818683.html a linguist professor becoming the most influential member of the party]. Martin Haase was in charge of translating all uploaded propositions in the system to a neutral language in order to avoid any ideological bias, making him grasp 167 delegations from other members. The consequences of having a monopolizing leader in a liquid democracy environment goes against the spirit of an ecosystem that aims to incentivize more participation. In liquid democracies ''celebrities'' can become extremely influential being able to attract most of the delegated votes. An attacker willing to subvert an election can promote a TV star wearing a QR code to get a sudden influx of delegations from fans and viewers, instantly becoming a monopolizing force.

=====2.3.4.1 Defense.=====

For this purpose a key setting of a liquid democracy system is to permit [http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/ quadratic voting] when it comes to delegations. This means that the cost for Alice to delegate votes to Bob increases exponentially the more votes get delegated. With quadratic delegations Alice can only delegate Bob 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or even 128 or 512 ''VOTEs'' but no value in between. This makes any delegation tax the delegator by reducing the opportunity cost of delegating to other members. This method prevents the rise of monopolies within the market dynamics of liquid democracies, always making the participation of all members relevant. Monopolies are a threat to liquid democracies since they can disincentivize less fortunate voters to participate, hijacking the legitmacy of the decisions being made. But if some organizations desire a more vertical chain of command (e.g. corporations), quadratic voting can still be disabled in the settings of a Sovereign implementation.

===2.4 Governance.===

<blockquote>
  Do you know what politics is? What you say and do in a given point in time.
</blockquote>
[https://twitter.com/juliococo '''Julio Coco'''], Venezuelan activist (1980).

Corporations and public institutions are prone to corruption because decisions often happen in secrecy behind closed doors and accounting happens over time. Effectively, organizations are ''decision laundering'' by disconnecting accountability from the decisions. The lack of an incorruptible timeline storing financial and political decisions enables such inaccountability. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(book) ''Leviathan'' State] is an inefficient machine: although it proclaims itself as the sovereign ruler for any given population by means of force, whoever is in charge of running its bureaucracy can still be corrupted.

Digital organizations that operate with distributed teams in virtual environments have the advantage of always documenting their work throughout every process by default. In this sense the open source movement has innovated on how large groups can collaborate. But they often rely on voluntary contributions, lack the means to reward efforts and governance is still in feudal times: projects can be dependent on a ''benevolent dictator'' able to discretionally call the shots to allocate resources.

====2.4.1 DAOs.====

<blockquote>
  Technology for democracy must be understood by the vast majority of citizens. It is the technology that we do not control the one that it is used to control us.
</blockquote>
[https://twitter.com/earlkman '''Emiliano Kargieman'''], space hacker (1975).

Building decentralized organizations has been attempted in the past. ''Distributed Autonomous Organizations'' (or DAOs) aim to be blockchain entities constructed with smart contracts that entirely automate decision processes and can run without any kind of human oversight. The code itself is meant to be the ultimate arbiter, hence these organizations claim that ''code is law''. But experience has taught that ''bugs are law'' too: when German company [http://slock.it Slock.it] implemented [http://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists/ the largest crowdfunded DAO in May 2016 able to raise over USD 100 million], a hacker exploited the code using a security hole in the smart contract controlling all funds triggering a recursive call that leaked USD 55 million worth of ether from this DAO.

We believe there is a clear lesson to be learned from this: the need for governance cannot be abstracted. Voting matters. The neural networks with the accumulated trained sets of a lifetime each human carries in one's head is a fundamental resource for savvy decision making. DAO driven entities surrender the political frontier between mankind and machines entirely to the machines. It is a well known risky path: financial markets have been dealing with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_crash flash crashes] and erratic glitches from trading bots [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987) since the introduction of the first computers]. Bitcoin's ongoing scaling debate between those who build its software and those who provide mining hardware suffers from the lack of a clear protocol for decision making often stagnating innovation. The vote is an instrument that helps streamline decision processes, taking the legitimate input of all interested parties into account. Nonetheless, we are not against a complimentary implementation of AIs interacting with the system. Sovereign implementations can include AIs as participants that can even receive ''VOTE'' delegations and represent members. But it is the act of voting, rather than code that can escape the comprehension of participants, what keeps the system as a whole auditable, transparent and democratic.

===2.5 Smart Contracts.===

The modern architecture for computing machines designed by John von Neumann specified that computers should be built with a rapid access memory (RAM), an information storage device and a central processing unit (CPU). The arrangement of these components led to the [https://www.amazon.it/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/1400075998 ''big bang'' of the digital universe] that took the world by surprise in the second half of the 20th century. With this in mind we focused on building an efficient design for a governance machine able to operate with blockchains that keeps its human operators as sovereign rulers by means of the vote. In the same way bits move in computers signalling a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> state, ''VOTEs'' signal a boolean state for institutional decisions recorded under smart contracts.

''VOTE'' tokens operate within the institutional boundaries created by this set of contracts: <code>Organizations</code>, <code>Members</code>, <code>Decisions</code>, <code>Ballots</code> and <code>Budgets</code>. These are the building blocks that help create a governance circuit that can scale to operate liquid democracies within communities of any size.

[[File:/images/vote-liquid-democracy-smart-contracts.png|VOTE Liquid Democracy smart contracts..]]

====2.5.1 <code>Organizations</code>====

The entity or institution implementing a Sovereign instance is referred as an ''Organization''. Every Organization has a ''constitutional smart contract'' able to determine how VOTEs will be allocated to its members. Allocation conditions are a prerogative of the organization depending on its goals: in some cases it can be aligned with financial rights (e.g. the shareholders of a corporation getting one ''VOTE'' per share); in other cases can be assigned based on an egalitarian distribution to all members (e.g. tax payers within a jurisdiction each getting a same amount of ''VOTEs'').

====2.5.2 <code>Members</code>====

Every Organization has members that get the right to vote on the decisions of the organization. Membership approval is defined in the ''constitutional smart contract'' of the organization, setting how open or closed as an institution this entity will be. Some organizations may allow for members to be instantly approved once they register with their credentials or pay a membership fee, while others might require an approval of pre-existing members that can vote on the status of an applicant as member.

A strict definition in the membership criteria of an organization is key for the trust on any democratic environment. Among the most common ways to subvert an election is the manipulation of voter registry. Securing this aspect with cryptographic means as well as an approval protocol is critical. Once a member is approved within an organization, he or she gets a specific amount of ''VOTEs'' to be used for its governance.

Compatibility with decentralized identity protocols is encouraged for the purpose of guaranteeing decentralized governance. The [https://opencreds.github.io/did-spec/ specification of DIDs (decentralized identifiers analogous to the web's URIs)], proposed by the [https://www.w3.org/ W3C] enabling self-sovereign verifiable digital identity is recommended.

====2.5.3 <code>Decisions</code>====

An organization consists of a collection of contracts each describing a decision to be made by the members. In the ''constitutional smart contract'' of an organization it can be defined whether any member or a subset with special rights (e.g. members that have a minimum amount of ''VOTEs'') can post an open decision to be voted. A decision in its most basic form has these properties:

* <code>Description</code>: Text of the decision to be made.
* <code>Tags</code>: Categories that describe this decision within the organization. This helps members navigate across decisions, define areas or teams within an organization and limit the scope of a delegation of ''VOTEs'' under liquid democracies. If the implementation is done with blockchain environments managing a fixed taxonomy, a common distributed language for tags helps making the democratic environment of an organization more fair as it avoids members trying to control naming conventions for their own benefit.
* <code>Signatures</code>: Members that are authoring the proposal. It can remain anonymous if an organization's governance rules allows it.
* <code>Ballot</code>: The presented options for voters to participate on this decision.
* <code>Budget</code>: An optional element that may include locked funds in a cryptocurrency address that can trigger an action if a decision is voted in support.
* <code>Timespan</code>: For the final tally, an open poll must also set its scope in time and define the kind of decision being made. There are two types of decisions:
** '''Tactical''' (''Time limited''): These are contracts that receive ''VOTEs'' until a closing date is met, where a given block height within the blockchain implementing the ''VOTE'' smart contracts can be set as the end line for the electoral process. Once all transactions have been tallied and a final result is recorded, all tokens get returned to the corresponding voters and can be used again on future decisions.
** '''Strategical''' (''Time unlimited''): Never-ending open polls that are perpetually registering the consensus of a decision state. ''VOTEs'' can be retrieved by voters at any given time if they feel the need to discontinue their voice in support or rejection of a decision. But as long as the token is assigned to signal a preference on a contract ballot without closing date, it is part of the strategical decision. A common use for strategical decisions can be the members signalling approval of other members within the community of an organization.

====2.5.4 <code>Ballot</code>====

A decision can be implemented with any possible ballot design according to the specifications defined in the ''constitutional smart contract'' of the organization. The building blocks for a ballot are its <code>Interface</code>, <code>Options</code> and <code>Criteria</code>.

=====2.5.4.1 <code>Interface</code>=====

By default Sovereign provides the most commonly used choice mechanisms for ballot interaction. Further innovation on ballot interfaces is encouraged.

* '''Single Choice''': One selectable option.
* '''Multiple Choice''': One or more selectable options.
* '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting Ranked Choice]''': Sortable options as ranked preferences.

=====2.5.4.2 <code>Options</code>=====

In order to enable the information processing of ''VOTEs'', ballots carry boolean values expressed in their options. This lets ''VOTE'' transactions signal a ''decision state'' that will act as a force modeling the institutional choices for the implementing organization. This makes all decentralized organizations also into programmable institutions. Options can then be:

* <code>True</code>: It will signal a <code>true</code> boolean value if selected (often described with 'Yes' or 'Positive' label strings).
* <code>False</code>: Signals a <code>false</code> state (e.g. can display 'No' or 'Negative' labels).
* <code>Linked</code>: The option is connected to another decision within the organization.
* <code>Candidate</code>: A member or list of members from the organization. This helps elect authorities within the organization or it can be used for membership approvals.

=====2.5.4.3 <code>Criteria</code>=====

Finally, counting methods for the final or ongoing result of a decision within an organization.

* '''Plurality Voting''': Simple majority wins decision.
* '''Majority Voting''': A minimum percentage is required for winning decision.
* '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method D’Hont method]''': Widely used by Nation-State elections based on member lists.
* '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method Schülze method]''': Commonly used by open source communities and Pirate Parties using ranked choice ballots.

====2.5.5 <code>Budget</code>====

If the final tally of a decision reaches a certain value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>), it can then enforce the final decision by unlocking coins to the private key owners of an address or triggering a transaction sending assets to a specific address. Budgets specify the conditions and funds attached to a decision.

==3. Plan.==

For Sovereign to be a trusted environment for decentralized governance under large communities (cities, nations or global scale), the system must be protected against the two main subversive strategies that democracies must deal with:

# '''Identity Manipulation''' (a.k.a. ''sybil attacks''): Whoever has the ability to control the registry of voters of any given election can directly influence the end result. A classical example is registering defunct members of society to vote in an election. On decentralized networks this is commonly referred as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack sybil attack] (a name taken from an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kPIDt3yu1M homonymous 1976 film] based on a character that suffers a multiple personality syndrome). Sybil nodes are those that identify themselves as independent actors in the network while they all are under the control of a single operator. In decentralized environments sybil attacks are the most common threat and for this reason we consider indispensable that for a token to be activated it must get validated through a protocol (social and algorithmic) that works as '''''Proof of Identity''''' (addressed on section 3.1).

# '''Gossip Dissemination''' (a. k. a. ''fake news''): It is no coincidence that the battlefield of modern democracies is disputed in the media. News organizations have unprecedented capacity to shape voter perception. Across different jurisdictions worldwide, governments wage an internal war between the State and the largest local media conglomerate. This is the playbook behind Donald Trump and his fight against the CNN & New York Times tandem; or the reason Vladimir Putin invested significant resources to create Russia Today in order to have a way of presenting alternative facts. Controlling the message tends to matter more than truth itself. Free media and independent journalism are a fundamental requirement for stable democracies. But if evidence of institutional facts are hard to prove, the room for manipulation is greater than the room for truth to prevail. Traditional institutions are secretive and lack transparency even if they are public offices. Blockchains enable a way of storing institutional facts that guarantees transparency in organizations. In this sense, ''fake news'' can be fought with a new institutional model able to store '''''Hard Promises''''' (addressed on section 3.2).

===3.1 Proof of Identity.===

 “The Internet was created without an identity layer.”


~Kim Cameron, Chief Architect of Identity for Microsoft

Identity is foundational to the achievement of personal sovereignty, so it must be a foundational building block of any system of voting and organizational governance. From Democracy Earth Foundation's perspective, a vote will always take place within an organization. It can be a Nation-State or a decentralized collective, but it will always be defined by its valid and verifiable membership. Therefore DEF's liquid democracy voting / decision-making platform will be organization-centric, meaning it will codify any organizational membership rules and ratifications related to digitally established identification.

Today’s standard identity systems are based on physical documents and processes, which has inherent limitations. Analogue identity systems put users at risk due to overexposure of information, plus the high risk of information loss or theft. Paper is easily forged, certainly relative to modern cryptography. In addition, nation-state issued IDs are becoming obsolete and are already insecure as populations are traveling and migrating more.

Meanwhile, in our online lives our personal identities are stored in a series of siloed gardens, each belonging to a different app/website/service provider - a situation that has resulted in a usability and privacy disaster for individuals, while creating a multitude of data honeypots for hackers—the breach of which compromises trust in all Internet services.

For that reason, the biggest blockchain opportunity of all is to own, manage and monetize our virtual identity --  an opportunity that today rests solely in the hands of digital conglomerates like Google, Facebook and Twitter.

The evolution of internet identity is the result of trying to satisfy three basic requirements: security (i.e. protected from unintentional disclosure), control (the identity owner enables access to his data) and portability, as in, the user can access their identity without being tied to a particular provider(s).

Recent developments in distributed computing are allowing the rise of  truly self-sovereign identity systems. Asymmetric cryptography ensures security from the user perspective, and trust between peers can arise in a decentralised manner, with the collection of credentials and reputation management. Because anyone can use these identities and the resulting benefits without an intervening authority, they’re called “self-sovereign.”

With trust itself being enabled by technologies and not institutions, the next evolution of the Internet will be the creation of a common identity layer that allows people, organisations and things to have their own self-sovereign identity that is secure, under their control, and always available to them, with no need for intermediary permissions.

[https://youtu.be/Irc-VMuUs3c?t=55m20s According to NYU professor David Yermack], newborn Roma Siri became the first baby to have a blockchain valid birth certificate. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/tsi4xo4k6j1jsa6/Blockchain%20Birth%20Certificate%20of%20Roma%20Siri%20-%20Daughter%20of%20Santiago%20Siri%20%28father%29%20and%20Pia%20Mancini%20%28mother%29.MOV?dl=0 The process],  even though symbolic at the time, is relatively simple to replicate with everyday technology.

[[File:/images/identity-blockchain.png|Self-sovereign Identity.]]

The world’s first transnational digital ID has already been pioneered by Estonia, with its e-Residency government-issued ID. Other examples of are moving forward in more than a dozen countries, including Norway, the Netherlands, Italy Poland and Thailand. Most of these programs now include biometrics, the majority in the form of fingerprints.

In his article “The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”, Christopher Allen charts the evolutionary path of the online identity landscape, describing 4 stages of development; in his vision, it is the the flourishing use of self-sovereign identity that ushers in the post-silo world.

<img width="570" alt="screen shot 2017-07-28 at 3 54 31 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18194034/28732612-d32aa4b6-73ae-11e7-8141-77a71a6eba66.png">

Yet for identities to be truly self-sovereign, they cannot be owned or controlled by governments, organizations or companies whose priority is value extraction from the user-owner. The Gov.UK Verify and India’s Aadhaar systems have been plagued by reports of improper security practices and data leaks (including banking details) compromising the privacy of millions of customers.
Microsoft is backing an open source initiative to develop a system with Blockstack and ConsenSys that will enable cross-blockchain registrations of identifiers for self-sovereign identities -- a transparent, open source, blockchain-based naming and identity layer for the world. Users will own their own self-sovereign identities and can prove ownership based on control of a private key linked to a known identifier.

In the publication Digital Identity Issue Analysis (Consult Hyperion 2016) it is noted that centralized organizations currently serving as identity providers will evolve to become "identity proofers" - someone still needs to carry out the checks that an individual is who they say they are as they bridge the digital and physical worlds. Standards of assurance will always need to be met and relying parties will always need to be able to trust such assurances: what will change is the ease and simplicity of doing such checks in an environment where individuals simply give permission to access verified data to satisfy the given criteria, and not be beholden to any one bastion of trust in order to have a digital identity.

===3.2 Hard Promises.===

The building blocks of institutions consist of facts stored in contracts. But the kind of facts these agreements contain are of a very specific type. Institutions are not built with ''objective facts'' that are scientific, measurable and independent from human judgment; but rather ''inter-subjective facts'' that build the social world within a community setting the relations of property and rights. For example, the notion that every red can of soda belongs to the Coca Cola Corporation is not objective but an inter-subjective fact agreed upon all members of society acknowledging the intellectual property rights that company has over its products. In this way, institutional reality helps [http://unenumerated.blogspot.com.es/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html scale economic relations and reduce the information required for organizations to transact].

The bureaucracies that protect these agreements depend on promises, i.e. “all money kept in banks will be there tomorrow”. But as [https://twitter.com/aantonop Andreas Antonopoulos] states: “We’re used to systems of ''soft promises'' and reversible transactions.” If the government (or any other kind of central authority) wanted to confiscate private funds stored in a bank, nobody can stop them from breaking that promise. This has been the experience of Greek, Argentine, Venezuelan or Puerto Rican citizens with their own defaulting governments in the past decade. Blockchain based organizations offer an alternative of ''hard promises'': agreements stored in smart contracts strictly protected by cryptographic keys that no single third party can corrupt. Corruption is at the core of every broken promise between representatives and their constituencies. It is due to the weak dynamics of central authority that fraudulent behavior gets rewarded. Inside trading, monetary inflation, capital controls are some of the behaviours that tend to apply to all but the friends of those in power. By removing the need of central authority, blockchain-based institutions (whether public or private) operate with higher defenses against corrupted authority. And as far as regulation goes, cryptography cannot be stopped since doing it would require prohibiting mathematics.

The goal we have set for the Democracy Earth Foundation is to pioneer blockchain governance by implementing a '''universal voting token''' compatible with any kind of institution. This technology can be used for the decision making process of multi-stakeholder organizations, private or public, small or large. As a Organization decision instrument, we are aware that the main challenge of democracy is not only scaling participation but also scaling the understanding of what is being voted. In that sense the aim for this token is to enforce the preferences of a specialized majority that is knowledgeable on the conflicting issues while guaranteeing protections to all participating minorities.

==4. Token Economics ==

[[File:/images/humans.png|Humans on Earth.]]

For a democracy to reach global scale, the tokens must find the means to effectively represent the interests of 7 billion lives and able to increase supply based on population growth. [https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/ United Nations estimates that by the year 2100 the world will reach population of 10 billion ''sapiens'']. This pressing fact goes to the core of what is behind the veils of climate change, refugees and rising inequality. How to optimize the distribution of opportunity to a population close to reaching the planet’s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity carrying capacity] by the end of this century must be urgently addressed.

We will issue an initial setup of 7,500,000,000 ''VOTEs'', setting the golden rule: one ''VOTE'' per living person. With [https://www.census.gov/population/international/ an estimated population growth rate of 1.1%], an average of 82,500,000 tokens will be added every year (i.e. a rate of 2.6 new tokens per second). Even though we are aware that it’s unrealistic to reach 100% of the globe’s population by taking the precedent of Facebook’s current user base of 2 Billion, being Democracy Earth Foundation - an organization giving people everywhere greater access to governance - we will tie our monetary policy to the constant reminder of how many lives are at stake and whose interests must be taken into consideration.

By connecting every ''VOTE'' to a living person, every financial metric derived from the token will instantly reflect the capacity of its holders to promote and build a borderless self-sovereign democracy. A ''VOTE''’s ''Market Capitalization'' will be synonym of [http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf Democratic Organization Welfare], and the value of a single ''VOTE'' will become a unit reflecting the purchasing power of an individual if an even distribution of the token was ever to be reached. The Democracy Earth Foundation will keep track of the token distribution within each nation, making it a reliable metric for the penetration of digital and decentralized democracy in populations living under a common set of cultural and genetic values.

It must be noted that even if we remain skeptical about the chances of Nation-States for planetary governance, this does not mean we don’t acknowledge the traditions and values binding the people of a nation together. In the same way blood ties evolved to signal identification of a family considering the widespread use of surnames attached to given names; territorial ties (nationality) is likely to become a third name among global citizens.

Members can interact with a Organization using ''VOTE'' transactions under different modes:

* '''Anonymous''': Corporations and private institutions (often referred as ''Anonymous Societies'' in many jurisdictions) can benefit by having a voting token secured over a blockchain that can easily interoperate with other crypto assets and without the requirement of having an approved member signature attached to the transaction. Anonymous entities holding legitimate ''VOTEs'' can interact with a Organization as long as the ''VOTEs'' have been granted by the Organization's constitution.

* '''Identified''': The rights to a ''VOTE'' can be obtained without a monetary transaction by means of a ''Proof of Identity''. A self sovereign citizen able to provide reliable evidence of his/her own identity and, in order to avoid any kind of central authority, also able to gather sufficient peer approval of this proof measured with a reputation algorithm  will have an ''Identified VOTE'' token. This state has as an incentive granting the holder rights to participate in all governance decisions related to the ''VOTE'' economy. If a ''VOTE'' has been connected to an identity, it cannot be traded on the market and instead it will trigger a ''Basic Income Mechanism'' (detailed in section 4.3) aimed specifically to the token holder.

* '''Corrupted''': Aware that attacks from adversaries aiming to subvert ''VOTE'' tokens are likely to happen, a feedback loop able to detect corrupted tokens will be put in place using the same voting algorithms implemented for approvals. If sufficient peers voted on the falsehood of a ''Proof of Identity'' tied to an ''Identified VOTE'' (reasons being duplicate detection, false information or fraud) then the token acquires a corrupted state and all the tied benefits to it are instantaneously lost locking out holder’s ability to transact in any way with it. If the token was used to signal votes, all peers or issues will loose these votes. Scrutiny of corrupted tokens will be of relevant used for the further improvement of vote tallying and ''Proof of Identity'' algorithms.

With those three states in place, the ''VOTE'' token will operate as a political and civic machine able to attract resources that will help flourish a peer to peer democracy anywhere.

===4.1 Right versus debt.===

Plato’s “Republic”, the founding work of Western political philosophy, begins with the following question: “What is justice?” To which Kefalos (capital), a wealthy arms manufacturer, says: “pay your debts and don’t lie”. Socrates immediately puts the response into question, but the association of debt, morality and wars remained to be at the root of the economic mental models of our society.

The origins of this mindset can be grasped from the historical context of the origin of coins. Money in the form of coins was first created by the great empires as a means to finance wars, enabling the purchase of provisions for soldiers in distant regions and rewarding them for the battles they won. Soldiers could loot silver and gold from their conquered cities and then exchange it afterwards, as the emperors imposed gold and silver coins onto their citizens, thus creating a market. After distributing coins, empires would also ask for a share of those coins to be given back, a tax, that was directed at the maintenance of the army. The moral narrative was that citizens were <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-First-5-000-Years/dp/1612191290">indebted</a> to the emperor for their security, for being alive.

Debt was transformed from being an oral contract, a promise, to a moral narrative capable to justify any form of coercion possible. Higher agents on vertical hierarchys could now enact forceful coercion onto lower agents: be that in the system of countries, companies or individuals. The transition from a trust economy to this new and impersonal form of trade coincided with the origins of philosophy, as the great Greek thinkers quickly grasped the inherent problem with debt: that it implies an arrangement between two legally equivalent entities. Democracy Earth Foundation's token will be distributed equally as a RIGHT, opposing the historical association of DEBT and moral, and thus generating a new breeding ground for transactions that are not based on the possibilities of coercion and need. Meanwhile, a system of Universal Basic Income aims to bring equivalence to entities, restoring balance and fairness as the new moral standard.


===4.2 Basic Income.===

The first recorded word for freedom in any human language is the Sumerian word "amargi" which literally means return to mother. That’s what would happen as debt forgiveness was enacted: debtors got to go home. As we can see, from the origins of the concept, freedom is a financial condition. Traditionally we think about politics and economics as two separate realms, but in reality we operate in a system where the two are inherently connected: money means power, and power means votes. This system is not compatible with democracy as a tiny percent of the society has a dispropotionate impact over the electoral and legislative process through their economic power. In order to create a truly democratic system for governance, we see necessary to bring the political-economic logic full circle. Therefore, VOTEs will be distributed through time, an asset that is, by nature, acessible to all.

<img width="200" alt="screen shot 2017-07-27 at 12 02 14 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18194034/28652569-e61d4c14-725e-11e7-8f2b-32a95a52bea4.png">

Every identified member of the network will have access to a Universal Basic Income that will be dripping through time. Time is a valuable and limited asset, therefore tradable. Tokenizing TIME and utilizing that as gas to VOTE liquidates a posession that every member of the network posesses equally, while ensuring their rights over the decision making process. On this context a Liquid Democracy is not only liquid because of how votes are unfrozen and can constantly change, but because every member of the network will literally have liquidity. We see this as an extremely intuitive innovation, a natural next step on the evolution of how humans organize. A new mental model. LIQUIDITY is needed for a true democracy to exist. As in free markets, voices must be able to be heard in order to count. Without ballots an election has no liquidity; without currency, a free market has no liquidity.  Just as voting is a 'right', a Universal Basic Income (or "UBI") is a fundamental human right. In a world where economies are interdependent, only a basic income that is truly Universal and not bounded by territorial nation-states can effectively tackle the coming challlenges of automation and artificial intelligence onto the labour market.

In addition to the VOTE token, DEF is creating a second token, designed to represent a citizen's right to be heard in public markets and as power represented by time.  The time token ["HOUR" or "HORA"] will be 'GRANTED', 'DRIPPED' AND 'EARNED' by every *Identified* VOTE token holder.

1 UNIT =  1 HOUR

Consensus ideal basic income is 10% of earnings.  Average global 'earnable' time is 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, 50 weeks per year - or 2,000 hours per year.  Therefore, an annual basic income would be the equivalent of 200 hours. It means that any organization deciding to adopt this currency has a 10% discount on the compensation it pays for its colaborators.

Adoption of the token is also incentivized as a political position: the era of mass market communications where companies avoided taking political stances is coming to an end. Increasingly consumption is becoming a political act, with products being articulators of one's identity and worldview. Consumers are becoming community members, and companies are being requested to be transparent about it's internal practices on the aquarium of the internet and social media. As the concept of currencies undergoes a massive disruption caused by distributed ledger technology, we offer a coin that is an articulator of human rights and democracy. What it means is that by utilizing our token organizations will be able to embody and promote those values. So on the great endeavor of building a true democracy, anyone trading on this network, or purchasing products from it, will be a contributor. An act of consumption will become as powerful as a vote.

<blockquote>
  “What happened to the governments?” I inquired. 
  “It is said that they gradually fell into disuse. Elections were called, wars were declared, taxes were levied, fortunes were confiscated, arrests were ordered, and attempts were made at imposing censorship — but no one on the planet paid any attention. The press stopped publishing pieces by those it called its ‘contributors,’ and also publishing their obituaries. Politicians had to find honest work; some became comedians, some witch doctors — some excelled at those occupations…”

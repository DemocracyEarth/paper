**1 - What is an open source paper?**

For us at Democracy Earth Foundation how a paper is made is almost as important as its content. Our belief in democracy means we believe that human collaboration is the best possible way to arrive at great solutions, therefore our project is written as an open source paper - a document where anyone is free to contribute. It is published under an open source license and we welcome contributions from anyone as we aim for this document to be a living roadmap for planetary governance. Democracy is always a work in progress, and so is our work: _The social smart contract_ is a living document that will be constantly updated and amended.

**2 - How can I contribute?**

For the purposes of our Initial Rights Offering all collaborations are encouraged between September 1st and October 10th. We are utilizing  Github as it does a great job at documenting the entire process of contributions. For more detailed information please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file of this repository. 

**3 - How is an Intial Rights Offering different from an Initial Coin Offering?**

Our token _Vote_ will be granted as a right to every human being by means of a Universal Basic Income, and it will have decision making as its primary function. In adittion to that it will be possible to access the _vote_ token through a financial mechanism and use it as an asset like any other crypto holding released through an Initial Coin Offering. The funds will be directed towards the construction of a  transnational network that will act in accordance to the personal sovereignty of its members and protect their human rights with encryption.

**4 - What is Liquid Democracy?**

It's a combination of Direct Democracy and Representative Democracy:

In _Direct Democracy_ everyone votes on every issue. 

In _Representative Democracy_ we choose other people to represent us. 

Liquid Democracy combines both to allow the voter to make decisions on the matters he/she cares about, and _delegate_ votes when there is someone that he/she trusts and considers to be more knowledgeable on the matter. A good way to think about it, is that we already live in Liquid Democracy, but its _frozen_: we can't change our vote for a certain period of time, only when there is a new election. Representative Democracy was the best that Nation-states could do with the technology of the time, but the internet and blockchain technologies allow us to do better now. 

**How does open source voting work - wouldn't it be easier to hack?**

**Isn't Open Source too new to be implementable in elections?**

Open-source systems are already playing a role in some elections, for example, New Hampshire has used open source software to allow disabled voters to fill out ballots online or on their phones.  The counties of Travis (Texas)  San Francisco and Los Angeles have budgets in place for open-source voting systems. Many major companies use open-source software including the US Department of Defense.

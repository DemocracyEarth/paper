# Papers should be written like open source software

A paper is almost always a collective effort, from peer review to friends and family contributions. All of it matters and shapes its final version.

In the end, how a paper is made can be almost as important as its content. What were the sections that the authors struggled with? What kind of concerns a specific idea raised? All of these conversations in their own uniqueness helped guiding the progression of thought.

In our opinion, Git provides the perfect set of tools to visualize the work behind writing a paper. Through commits, pull requests and issues one can see who contributed, and in what way and what effect it had on the final version. In adittion, we see a paper like _The social smart contract_ to be a living document that is constantly updated and amended. As developers we know the documentation of democracy's evolution, like democracy itself, is always a work in progress.

We decided to use this technology to draft _The Social Smart Contract_ and we encourage others to join in to bring more transparency and collaboration to this process.

Use pull requests to suggest modifications to the paper. Here are a few guidelines for pull request creation:
